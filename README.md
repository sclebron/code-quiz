I created a timed quiz that gives the user 75 seconds to complete a quiz consisting of 5 questions. Once the user selects the "Start Quiz" button, the timer begins counting down. When the user gets an answer incorrect the timer will immediately subtract 10 seconds. Once the user answers all questions, or the timer reaches 0, the quiz is complete. The user can then input their initials to save their score. Scores are saved in localStorage and there is a "View High Scores" button where the user can view previous scores.
